Line charts depicting the death rate due to diseases of the heart for citizens of New York. 
While observing the data fron "New York City Leading Causes of Death" dataset (found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam"), I noticed that diseases of the heart yielded either the highest or the second highest death rates for every single demographic in the city. I used that information to create this series of line charts, which depicts the death rate of heart disease for the years 2015-2019 for each of four ethnic backgrounds: Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Asian and Pacific Islander. These line charts show the unfortunate truth that not only is heart disease consistently killing more citizens than other ailments, but it is also disproportionately affecting Black Americans within NYC.
